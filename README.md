Installation
To install, simply run the following command in your project's root directory:

```npm install```
Usage
Once installed, you can start using TypeScript in your project by creating a tsconfig.json file in your project's root directory. This file will contain the configuration for your TypeScript compiler.

To compile your TypeScript files, you can use the following command:

```npm run build```

This will compile all TypeScript files in your project.

If you are using npm scripts, you can add a script to your package.json file to compile your TypeScript files:



```{"scripts" : { "build" : "tsc" } }```
You can then run the script with the following command:


```npm run dev```
