Installation
To install, simply run the following command in your project's root directory:
```npm install```

Usage
Once installed, you can start using TypeScript in your project by creating a tsconfig.json file in your project's root directory. This file will contain the configuration for your TypeScript compiler.

To compile your TypeScript files, you can use the following command:
```npm run build```

This will compile all TypeScript files in your project.

If you are using npm scripts, you can add a script to your package.json file to compile your TypeScript files:
```{"scripts" : { "build" : "tsc" } }```

You can then run the script with the following command:```npm run dev```

Additional Resources
For more information on using TypeScript with npm, check out the TypeScript documentation.

this server project has 2 endPoints with one beta operation and one non-error operation.

Both in the scope to be used have no problems at the time of application but being so simple the solution was added a more detailed way to apply solutions, however the amount of validations are enough.
